# Quickstart

## Install once

Use a desktop Windows, macOS, or Linux session with Node.js 22+ and npm. Get the source through Git (`git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL`) or GitHub's Download ZIP, then open a terminal in the directory containing `package.json`.

```sh
node scripts/setup.mjs
npm run doctor
npm start
```

These commands work in PowerShell, Command Prompt, zsh, bash, and terminal-based AI harnesses. The setup script runs `npm ci` against the committed lockfile, verifies the Electron download, and reuses a matching completed install. Use `node scripts/setup.mjs --force` to reinstall. It installs the Electron runtime, renderer and build tools; it does not install an LLM. Prefer a short checkout path, especially on Windows. There are no hardcoded home directories or working-directory-dependent bridge paths.

## Play with Codex (recommended)

```sh
npm start
```

The first launch shows a setup screen with three checks:

1. **Guard AI (Codex):** Guard Lab looks for a Codex executable (Settings path, `GUARD_LAB_CODEX`, your PATH, the ChatGPT desktop app's bundled CLI). If you're signed out, click **Sign in with ChatGPT**. If Codex is missing or broken, click **Copy fix prompt**, paste it into Codex or ChatGPT, then **Check again**.
2. **Voices (Kokoro, about 96 MB):** natural voices for the guard and you.
3. **Voice input (Whisper, about 130 MB):** hold <kbd>Space</kbd> to talk; release to send.

Everything is optional: without Codex you get the practice guard, without Kokoro speech uses system voices, and without Whisper you type. You can rerun setup from Settings.

Pick **Employee** (cross the room and leave through the exit; your pass proves you may pass) or **Thief** (steal the item and escape alive), bring one item, and press **Start**. The guard can't see your role.

**Settings → Guard** picks the model, reasoning effort and fast mode (default GPT-6 Luna, low, fast on). Codex runs on your own Codex sign-in, in a separate ephemeral thread per encounter with your plugins, MCP servers and coding tools turned off, so the guard sees only the game. Faster settings make the guard react sooner; heavier reasoning makes it slower. `npm run doctor` reports what Codex Guard Lab found.

## Terminal agent bridge

```sh
npm run live
```

Ask Codex, Claude Code or another terminal agent to read `AGENTS.md` and play the guard (or the human with `--actor=human`). Launch this as a persistent process; do not give the launcher a short timeout that kills the app. The agent starts with `node scripts/robot-link.mjs listen --compact`, then uses `exchange ACTION --id=REPLY_ID --compact` to submit and await the next packet in one call. Keep the harness turn open until the encounter ends: a final chat answer disconnects the agent, and the app cannot wake it. Select the model and reasoning in your harness. [Latency measurements](LATENCY.md) describe the comparison. The bridge needs no network after dependencies are installed.

## Direct local or API connection

Open **Settings → Guard**, choose **Your model**, choose endpoint and model, test the connection, and save. API credentials remain in memory for that app session. The protocol is tool-capable `/chat/completions` plus `/models`; a text-only endpoint, provider-native API, or provider with a different tool format needs an adapter. Use a model that can follow one tool call per turn. No particular vendor is required.

| Provider       | API base URL                | Setup                                                                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ollama         | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | Install/run Ollama separately, pull a tool-capable model, click Ollama and select an installed model |
| LM Studio      | `http://localhost:1234/v1`  | Load a tool-capable model and start its local server                                                 |
| Compatible API | Your provider's base URL    | Enter its model ID and optional API key                                                              |

The app lists models from your running server; it neither downloads models nor chooses a subscription. [Ollama's API documentation](https://docs.ollama.com/api/openai-compatibility) describes its compatibility interface. [LM Studio's documentation](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/developer/openai-compat) describes its local endpoint. Other agents may use the vendor-neutral live bridge instead of a direct API.

## Secondary modes

On the home screen, use **Other modes**. **Play as guard** gives you the robot controls and a human AI that chooses its own item. **AI vs AI** uses two independent connections. Each AI side can use Codex, a local/API model, the practice policy, or a terminal agent. For live human use `--actor=human` on bridge commands. A guard live agent uses the default robot channel. Pause/resume is available; long automated games pause after 100 rounds. A scripted demo is a deterministic convenience policy, not an LLM experiment.

## Voices and voice input

The setup screen and **Settings → Voice** download, test and remove the models. From a terminal:

```sh
npm run voices:install            # Kokoro and Whisper
npm run voices:install -- --tts   # Kokoro only
npm run voices:install -- --stt   # Whisper only
```

Models download from Hugging Face into app data `models/` (set `HF_ENDPOINT` to use a mirror, or `--from=DIR` to install from a local copy). After installation everything runs offline on your CPU through onnxruntime. Microphone audio is captured only while you hold the push-to-talk key and stays in memory. On macOS the first recording asks for microphone permission; on Windows check **Settings → Privacy → Microphone** if recording is blocked. Kokoro and Whisper need the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime on Windows (included with most PCs); if voices fail to load there, install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft. Review [model terms](../THIRD_PARTY.md) before redistribution.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`/`npm` missing           | Install the official Node.js distribution and reopen the terminal                                                                                                |
| Electron missing               | Run `node scripts/setup.mjs`; installation must permit dependency lifecycle scripts                                                                              |
| Desktop does not open on Linux | Use a graphical session and run `npm run doctor` to identify missing system libraries. Headless tests, `npm run scenario`, and the bridge work without a display |
| Live agent waits               | Start the encounter and take a human action. Match the channel and environment variables between launcher and agent                                              |
| Stale/duplicate response       | Observe a fresh packet; use its exact ID once                                                                                                                    |
| Tool rejected                  | Read the current schema and sensors. Check range, visibility, ammo and cooldown; do not invent a successful outcome                                              |
| No speech                      | Unmute, interact once to unlock audio, then install or test Kokoro in Settings → Voice                                                                           |
| Codex not found or signed out  | Use the setup screen's Sign in or Copy fix prompt; or set the executable in Settings → Guard → Advanced                                                          |
| Two sessions interfere         | Use a different `GUARD_LAB_DATA_DIR` for each app and its agent                                                                                                  |
| Port already used              | The source launcher automatically picks another available loopback port                                                                                          |
| API connection fails           | Verify model/server/tool support. `/models` must respond and its model ID must be saved                                                                          |

Source builds are the baseline cross-platform experience. macOS/Linux runtime testing and packaging can be run by the supplied CI matrix; platform-specific display/graphics support is still required. Nothing in this repository grants a harness permissions it does not already have.
